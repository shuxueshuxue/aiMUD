## This is aiMUD, a AI-driven interactive fiction game engine

This project combines natural language processing and a keyword-based system to create an interactive fiction game experience. The game world is dynamically managed by an AI narrator.

The aim of this project is to provide an easy-to-use framework for large-scale AI fiction game development.

It supports multiplayer.
